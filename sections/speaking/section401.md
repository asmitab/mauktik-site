**At the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR), India. Of late, neuroscience has emerged as one of the most intriguing fields of research. Often termed as the final frontier, the brain is the most complicated, fascinating, and least understood organ of all the biological systems. In addition to developing new tools to understand the inner workings of the brain, neuroscience has also started posing some tough legal, social and ethical issues related to science. The implications of new neuroscientific discoveries and inventions are not limited to the medical field. Rather, new techniques aimed at “reading” human thoughts to understand what actions they are planning, and directly controlling thoughts and actions, are bringing up philosophical issues about free will, relationships and our belief systems.**

**This lecture reviews some of the latest experiments with somewhat exciting, somewhat weird and somewhat scary implications for the society.  It also touches upon the philosophy of law and the role of public policy and legal frameworks in shaping the future of neuroscience.**
